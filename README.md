# Hello, I'm Pablo 👋

I am a **Business Analytics Student** focused on bridging the gap between raw data and actionable business strategy.

My goal is to evolve into a builder of data-driven solutions. I am interested in not just analyzing what happened, but designing **engineering systems** that help predict what will happen next and automate decision-making processes.

### 🎯 My Focus
* **Building:** I enjoy creating end-to-end data pipelines and deploying machine learning models into production.
* **Solving:** I approach data scienceass a tool to solve business problems.
* **Collaborating:** I value clear communication and believe that the best solutions come from understanding the needs of both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

### 🔧 The Stack
* **Analysis & Engineering:** Python, SQL, R.
* **Data Science:** Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch.
* **Visualization & Dashboarding:** Tableau, PowerBI.
* **Tools:** Git, Jupyter, Docker.
